Has your mouse ever started to give you weird double clicks or opening multiple tabs while middle-clicking on a link
on your web browser? If you are like me you might be going through mice on a yearly basis.

I created this simple solution while learning C# to detect and diagnose whether your mouse buttons are really broken
or if you're just being paranoid. You can use it to detect left, right and middle clicks as well as scrolling before
opening up your mouse and fixing it. Or in my case breaking it completely and having to buy a new one.
